## PREAMBLE

This software is **PARODY**. It is **SATIRE**. It is a **JOKE**.

If you have arrived at this repository believing that you can actually:
- Stream your SAP IDOCs to TikTok
- Use a fax machine as a webhook receiver
- Achieve "quantum entanglement" with your ABAP/4 code
- Generate blockchain-verified Material Master records

...then we need to have a serious conversation about your critical thinking
skills, your understanding of enterprise software, and possibly your
relationship with reality itself.

**This is not real software. This has never been real software. This will
never be real software.** It is a commentary on the absurdity of enterprise
buzzwords, over-engineered architectures, and the general state of
corporate technology marketing.

If you did not immediately recognize this as satire, please:
1. Close this repository
2. Take a walk outside
3. Touch grass
4. Reflect on your life choices
5. Perhaps read "The Emperor's New Clothes" - it's a good story
6. Return only when you have recalibrated your satire detection sensors

## THE ACTUAL LICENSE

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a
copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"),
to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation
the rights to copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or
sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

### Condition 1: Recognition of Parody

You acknowledge that this Software is **PARODY** and **SATIRE**. By using,
copying, or even looking at this Software, you confirm that you understand
it is a joke. If you do not understand jokes, this license does not apply
to you, and you should probably avoid comedy clubs, satire publications,
and family gatherings where sarcasm may occur.

### Condition 2: No Actual Use

This license explicitly **DOES NOT** grant you the right to:
- Run, execute, or use the Software in any production environment
- Present this Software to your management as a real solution
- Include this in any RFP response
- Charge clients for implementing this
- Deploy the "17-layer middleware stack" anywhere
- Actually connect a fax machine to anything
- Attempt quantum entanglement with your SAP system

You may, however:
- Laugh at it
- Share it with colleagues who need a laugh
- Use it as an example of what NOT to do in enterprise architecture
- Print it out and hang it in your office as a warning
- Reference it in conference talks about enterprise software absurdity

### Condition 3: Liability Waiver (The Important Bit)

**THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, QUANTUM COHERENCE,
BLOCKCHAIN VALIDITY, TIKTOK ENGAGEMENT, CONSULTANT PROXIMITY, OR
VIBRATIONAL ALIGNMENT.**

**IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS, COPYRIGHT HOLDERS, CONTRIBUTORS, OR ANYONE
WHO HAS EVER LOOKED AT THIS CODE BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, QUANTUM
DECOHERENCE, SAP NOTE IMPLEMENTATION, TRANSPORT REQUEST FAILURE, CAREER
CONSEQUENCES, EXISTENTIAL CRISIS, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR
IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
SOFTWARE.**

This includes, but is not limited to:
- Any attempt to actually install this in Wappler
- Any attempt to connect this to a real SAP system
- Any attempt to stream IDOCs to social media
- Any misunderstanding by management about what this does
- Any consulting engagement gone wrong
- Any fax machine-related injuries
- Any damage to your professional reputation
- Any loss of employment resulting from presenting this as a real solution
- Any psychological damage from reading the German comments
- Any spiritual damage from the SAP ritual code
- Any temporal paradoxes from the "time-travel debugging" feature
- Any existential crises triggered by the middleware architecture diagram

### Condition 4: Attribution with Acknowledgment of Absurdity

The above copyright notice, this permission notice, and the phrase
"THIS IS A PARODY" shall be included in all copies or substantial
portions of the Software.

Any redistribution must maintain the satirical nature of the Software.
Converting this into actual working software would be:
a) Technically impressive
b) Deeply concerning
c) A violation of this license
d) Probably a sign you need a vacation

### Condition 5: The "Klaus Clause"

Any code attributed to "Klaus" in the comments shall remain unmodified,
as Klaus is in retirement and cannot be reached for clarification.
Modifying Klaus's code will result in undefined behavior, both in the
software and in your career trajectory.

## SPECIAL PROVISIONS

### For Enterprise Architects
If you are an enterprise architect and you found this repository while
searching for actual SAP-Wappler integration solutions, please understand
that this is not it. However, we recommend examining why a parody
repository ranked in your search results and what that says about the
current state of enterprise software documentation.

### For SAP Consultants
We see you. We understand you. The passive-aggressive German comments
are not directed at you personally. They are directed at the collective
trauma of everyone who has ever debugged an ABAP program at 3 AM while
questioning their career choices. You are valid. Your frustration is valid.
Klaus was real, and his code haunts us all.

### For Management
If you are a manager who received this link from a developer, they are
trying to tell you something. Listen to them. Buy them coffee. Perhaps
reconsider that "blockchain-enabled SAP integration" initiative.

### For Recruiters
No, familiarity with this repository does not count as "SAP experience"
on a resume. Please stop asking.

### For Legal Departments
This is a joke. Please do not send cease and desist letters over a joke.
We have enough problems. We work with SAP. Have mercy.

## FINAL DISCLAIMER

If, despite all of the above warnings, disclaimers, and increasingly
desperate pleas for common sense, you STILL attempt to use this Software
for any purpose other than amusement, education about what not to do, or
as a conversation starter at awkward networking events, then:

1. You assume ALL responsibility for the consequences
2. You waive any right to complain
3. You acknowledge that you were warned (SO MANY TIMES)
4. You accept that this is entirely on you
5. You agree to tell the story at conferences so others may learn

**Remember: The real enterprise integration was the friends we made along
the way, and the consultants we paid $500/hour to tell us what we already
knew.**

## CONTACT

For questions about this license, please:
- Do not contact us
- We are not lawyers
- This is not legal advice
- This is barely coherent advice
- Please seek professional help (not from us)
